## Introduction 
Unity is a cross platform game engine with which more than 50% of the world's games were developed. It is used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices, and
websites. Unity provides a user-friendly development environment for creating
2D and 3D games, with a drag-and-drop interface for adding objects, materials, and animations.
It also includes a scripting API in C#, which enables developers to add complex game logic and
behavior. In addition, Unity supports a large community of asset creators and developers,
allowing users to easily find and incorporate 3D models, sound effects, and
animations, into their games. Whether you are a seasoned game developer or just starting out,
Unity offers a powerful and flexible platform for creating games that can run on a variety of
platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and WebGL.

## Advantages and disadvantages
### Advantages of Unity
Unity is a popular game development platform that offers several advantages for developers. One of the primary benefits of Unity is its cross-platform development capabilities. With just one codebase, developers can create games that can run on multiple platforms, such as PCs, consoles, mobile devices, and websites, saving both time and resources. Unity also provides a user-friendly interface that is easy for new users to navigate. Additionally, the platform has a large community of developers and asset creators who contribute to the platform, making it easy to find tutorials, assets, and solutions to common problems. Unity comes with a variety of built-in tools and features, including a physics engine, animation system, and scripting API, which eliminates the need for developers to create these components from scratch. Finally, Unity provides several monetization options for game developers, such as in-app purchases, advertising, and subscriptions, allowing developers to generate revenue from their games.

### Disadvantages of Unity
Despite its numerous advantages, Unity also has some limitations and challenges that developers may encounter. One of the most significant issues is performance problems, particularly on mobile devices with limited hardware resources, resulting in slow and laggy games. Additionally, although Unity has a user-friendly interface, the underlying system can be complex, and some tasks, such as optimizing game performance, can be challenging. Another potential challenge is the cost, as advanced features and plugins can be expensive, making it difficult for small or independent game developers who have limited budgets. Finally, because Unity is a high-level game engine, it can be difficult to access and control low-level components such as memory management and threading, limiting the potential of some games and affecting performance. These factors should be taken into account when choosing a game development platform.

Overall, Unity provides a powerful and flexible platform for game development, but it may not
be the best choice for all projects. It is always better to weigh the advantages and disadvantages
carefully when deciding whether to use Unity for our games.

## Similar platforms, advantages and disadvantages:
Unity is one of the top game engines, but in order to properly decide which platform is better
for a certain project it is good to contrast and compare some of the most popular game
engines. There are several close competitors to Unity in the game development market. One popular option is Unreal Engine, developed by Epic Games, which is known for its powerful suite of tools and is widely used for developing high-quality 3D games. Another option is Godot, an open-source game engine designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with strong support for 2D games. CryEngine, developed by Crytek, is known for its high-quality graphics and powerful tools, making it a great choice for visually stunning games. GameMaker Studio is another popular game engine that's easy to use, even for those with no programming experience, and has a large community of users, making it a great choice for developing 2D games. Finally, Construct is a game engine specifically designed for creating 2D games, known for its user-friendly interface and suitability for beginners and small development teams. 
Choosing the right game engine depends on the specific needs and goals of the game developer or team.
Each of these engines has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice for a
particular project will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of game being
developed, the level of experience, and budget.

## Getting started and first tutorial:
• **Install Unity:** To get started with Unity, you will need to download and install the
software. You can download Unity from the official website: https://unity.com/

• **Start a new project:** Once you have installed Unity, start a new project by clicking on the
"New" button in the Project tab. Give your project a name, select a location to save it,
and choose a default template (e.g. 2D or 3D).

• **Create a scene:** In Unity, a scene is a collection of objects that make up a level or
environment in your game. To create a new scene, go to File > New Scene.

• **Add objects:** To add objects to your scene, you can use the Unity Editor to create and
place them. For this tutorial, you can add a simple sphere to your scene by going to
GameObject > 3D Object > Sphere.

• **Apply materials:** To apply materials to your objects, you can use the Unity Editor to
select and apply materials. For this tutorial, you can apply a simple red material to your
sphere by creating a new material, selecting the material in the Assets panel, and then
dragging the material onto the sphere in the Scene view.

• **Add a script:** To add behavior to your objects, you can use scripts written in C#. For this
tutorial, you can add a simple script to make the sphere rotate. To do this, you can
create a new script, attach the script to the sphere, and add the following code:

```
using UnityEngine;
public class RotateSphere : MonoBehaviour
{
 public float speed = 10.0f;
 void Update()
 {
 transform.Rotate(0, speed * Time.deltaTime, 0);
 }
}
````

## Augmented/Virtual Reality in Unity!
Apart from the games we usually see, Unity takes it to the next level and allowes creators to develop Augemented and Virtual Reality applications 
with the same format. As long as you know how to use Unity to create normal games, you already know how to create application in AR/VR with Unity --
You don't need to learn anything new to do so!

• **Play the game:** To play the game and see the sphere rotate, you can press the Play
button in the Unity Editor. You can also stop the game by pressing the Play button again.
This is just a basic tutorial to get started with Unity. Now lets see a more game-like example.
